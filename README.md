Just playing around trying to build parallax websites in 2016

1. Add in a web pack config for local development
2. Get less and basic local javascript to build up for client side
3. Integrate with existing parallax project to get in parallax effects
4. Thing about how to integrate in some of the data
5. Start to build up some dynamic graphs
