Just playing around trying to build parallax websites in 2016

[x]1. Add in a web pack config for local development
[x]2. Get less and basic local javascript to build up for client side
[]3. Integrate with existing parallax project to get in parallax effects
[]4. Thing about how to integrate in some of the data
[]5. Start to build up some dynamic graphs

webpack – for building once for development
webpack -p – for building once for production (minification)
webpack --watch – for continuous incremental build
webpack -d – to include source maps
webpack --colors – for making things pretty
